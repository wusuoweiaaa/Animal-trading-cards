			<p>Giraffes are the world's tallest mammals, thanks to their towering legs and long necks. A giraffe's legs alone are taller than many humansâ€”about 1.8 meters. These long legs allow giraffes to run as fast as 56 kilometers an hour over short distances and cruise comfortably at 16 kilometers an hour over longer distances.</p>
